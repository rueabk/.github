# 🤖 AdaptiFleet: The Flexible, VLM-Powered Autonomous Fleet

> **Vision:** Bridging the "Human Intent Gap" to create fully autonomous warehouses and robot fleets capable of delivering on-demand fulfillment in any environment—from logistics to healthcare and beyond.

## 🌟 The Mission
Traditional warehouse automation is rigid and hard to reconfigure. **AdaptiFleet** solves this by using a single, adaptable AI brain—powered by **Google Gemini 3 Pro VLMs**—to manage a fleet of robots. Non-technical users can deploy complex automation using natural language commands, enabling **10x faster deployment** and **95% reduction in downtime**.



## 🏗️ Technical Architecture
Our modular "Digital Twin Stack" ensures simulation-validated intent meets real-world execution across our five core modules:

1. **[Dashboard](https://github.com/om3gaholdings/nowww3/)** - The tactical "Mission Control" center for live robot tracking and map overlays.
2. **[Gemini robotics backend](https://github.com/rueabk/robotics_backend)** - The Gemini-powered reasoning engine for semantic hazard detection and task planning.
3. **[Isaac Sim Environment](https://github.com/AdaptiFleet/isaac-sim-files)** - High-fidelity physics simulation for rapid validation of warehouse and office behaviors.
4. **[ROS2 Bridge Middleware](https://github.com/AdaptiFleet/ros2-bridge)** - The communication layer transforming simulated world data for the frontend.
5. **[AI Order Backend](https://github.com/AdaptiFleet/ai-backend)** - Inventory management and customer-to-operator notification bridge.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap
AdaptiFleet scales beyond logistics into **Healthcare** (medication delivery), **Defense** (unpredictable environment logistics), **Corporate Offices**, and **Entertainment**.
